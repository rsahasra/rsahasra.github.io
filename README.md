# Portfolio: Rachna Sahasrabudhe
## Introduction
Hi! My name is Rachna and I'm a 3rd year Computer Science major at Georgia Tech, with concentrations in Intelligence and Information Internetworks. I'm passionate about problem solving, sustainability, and learning new skills. I was a STEP Intern at Google on the Growth Payments Platform team, and I'm a Teaching Assistant for Intro to Object Oriented Programming. As a teaching assistant, I've also been a Materials Lead and Programming Exercise Lead. 
## Projects

### Machine Learning Landscape Scene Recognition Project
This was a project I worked on in Summer 2020, to create various classifiers for different types of landscape images, using the MIT Places dataset. I worked with different models such as K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and then finally Convolutional Neural Networks.

### Humanitech VIP: Crop Pricing App
In this Vertically Integrated Project, I am working in a team to create a crop pricing app that farmers in Kenya can use to determine how to price their crops. We are parsing and connecting agricultural data to put it into a user-friendly web app. My first semester I focused on the backend and data collection side, which focused mostly on Python, web parsing, and getting the data into our backend. In Spring of 2021, I focused on the front end and creating the basic structure of the website.  Our team focuses on designing for the users and also does research on the best design practices for making a useful application. This semester (Fall 2021) we hope to have a basic website up, with the data parser running in the cloud, and to be able to get feedback from our users. We have also done a lot of documentation of our process so that future team members of the VIP can continue the project.

### Decision Tree Covid-19 & BCG Vaccine Correlation Analysis
In this project I worked with a couple datasets presented in the Kaggle Data Analysis Challenge linked below. It involved conducting research on bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin, a vaccine given to children to prevent tuberculosis, and it's potentially negative correlation with Covid-19 cases. The hackathon was started in response to a paper from researchers at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research question was to determine to what extent there was a correlation between countries that had BCG vaccination policies, and the rates of Covid-19 cases in those countries. The presentation I've linked below includes a general exploration of the data, as well as my Random Forest and Decision Tree Classifier results. This project was my first time using R, and I really enjoyed the process.
